
The spreadsheets in this folder rely on the availability of a java compiler in the JVM.
Hence, the spreadsheets require that "Obba Server" is launched from a JDK (1.6 or better).
A JRE is not sufficient.

One way to active this is:

- Download and install a Java Development Kit (JDK) if it is not already installed.

- Launch Obba Server from the JDK, i.e. via command line like
  (OS X, Unix):
	path-to-jdk/bin/java -jar Obba.jar
  (Windows)
	path-to-jdk\bin\java.exe -jar Obba.jar
